Fermi in the air is a console-based video game, developed by team Fermi for the Advanced C# teamwork project at SoftUni. 

The main theme of the game is a battle between a lone combat spacecraft, who has to fight with the falling blue bricks
and collect coins. The game makes heavy use of humor, especially in the form of parodies of the movie Star Wars, the famous
video game Chicken Invaders and the classic game Space Invaders.
